        "It's important to note that there is no comparison between the different types of programming paradigms. Since software is nothing but knowledge representation, the answer to the question: \"What is the best way to represent my problem?\" is choosing a specific programming paradigm.\n",

        "**Machine learning** uses a healthy mix of imperative programming and functional programming with a dash of immutability. Feature extraction and preprocessing are best approached functionally, as they require mathematical processing of data because mappings, reductions, and filtrations can pretty much be done in parallel without much dependence on each others' data points. Training of machine learning models is best approached via old-school imperative programming, as optimizing functions' value (a.k.a. the state of the program) needs to be updated at each iteration and therefore requires sequential execution at many points in the algorithm. It is quicker than functional programming in that case. It also avoids creating copies of everything after each step; instead it just updates the previous-value placeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Deep learning** can be performed well in a functional manner, as deep learning models are compositional. The entire process optimizes a set of composite functions, weights are immutable and stateless, and updates can be applied in any order as long as corresponding inputs are computed. Using functional programming provides concurrency and parallelism at no cost and also makes it easier to work with large, distributed models. There are also certain custom paradigms where functional programming is intertwined with informational theory to avoid overfitting in the statistical models.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data manipulation** can be approached with either functional or object-oriented programming. In the functional programming way, everything is immutable, algorithms are expressed succinctly, and there is native pattern matching, but formulation of the mathematical expression-like command is an art. Approaching it in an object-oriented programming way provides for recursive and iterative loops and a class-based structure that makes it easier to scale for bigger data and new functions. The downside is that the algorithms and the code logic are not expressed in a readable way. Although both paradigms tend to have an automatic garbage-collection system and can access and manipulate databases smoothly, the choice of which one to choose is heavily dependent on the programmer's knowledge.\n",

        "There is a high probability that any two developers would disagree on the best coding style for any situation and have valid arguments to support their opinion. The amazing thing about Python is that it lets you choose the programming paradigm that works the best for you in a given situation.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the above examples demonstrate, a task can always be broken into sub-tasks where each smaller part is coded in a completely different paradigm. The mix-and-match style works perfectly as long as the packages used are minimal, the inputs and outputs are clearly defined, and the complexity is moderated. There are no rules that say you can’t combine styles as needed. Python doesn’t stop in the middle of interpreting your application and display a style error when you mix styles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because there is no perfect guidebook for choosing a correct coding style for a given use case, the best suggestion is to try several paradigms weighing in their pros and cons until you find the one that leads to a simple yet efficient solution. There will be times during this experimentation when you will see that instead of using a single style throughout, a combination of programming paradigms works better for different parts to a solution. \n",
