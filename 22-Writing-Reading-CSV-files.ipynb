Because it’s a plain text file, it can contain only actual text data—in other words, printable ASCII or Unicode characters.\n","\n","The structure of a CSV file is given away by its name. Normally, CSV files use a comma to separate each specific data value. Here’s what that structure looks like:\n","\n","column 1 name,column 2 name, column 3 name\n","first row data 1,first row data 2,first row data 3\n","second row data 1,second row data 2,second row data 3\n","\n","\n","Notice how each piece of data is separated by a comma. Normally, the first line identifies each piece of data—in other words, the name of a data column. Every subsequent line after that is actual data and is limited only by file size constraints.\n","\n","In general, the separator character is called a delimiter, and the comma is not the only one used. Other popular delimiters include the tab (\\t), colon (:) and semi-colon (;) characters. Properly parsing a CSV file requires us to know which delimiter is being used.\n","\n","\n","# Where Do CSV Files Come From?\n","\n","CSV files are normally created by programs that handle large amounts of data. They are a convenient way to export data from spreadsheets and databases as well as import or use it in other programs. For example, you might export the results of a data mining program to a CSV file and then import that into a spreadsheet to analyze the data, generate graphs for a presentation, or prepare a report for publication.\n","\n","CSV files are very easy to work with programmatically. Any language that supports text file input and string manipulation (like Python) can work with CSV files directly.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jUGCmy7jHhke","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Reading and Writing CSV files\n","\n","\n","## Reading CSV Files With csv\n","\n","Reading from a CSV file is done using the reader object.
